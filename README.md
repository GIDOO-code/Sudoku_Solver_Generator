# In development  .Net Core version.
  Add description to code GeneralLogic and its auxiliary routein.<br>
  "GeneralLogic" completeness is about 30%.<br>
   -Currently,it takes a few seconds to solve a size 3 problem.<br>
   -As an expectation, I would like to solve a size 5 problem in a few seconds.<br>
   -Probably need a new theory.<br>

# Sudoku_Solver_Generator
![GNPX](/images/GNPX_start.png)

Sudoku analysis and generation C# program.
The only algorithm used is non-backtracking.  
The algorithm used is  
>Single, LockedCandidate, (hidden)LockedSet(2D-7D),
  (Finned)(Franken/Mutant/Kraken)Fish(2D-7D),
  Skyscraper, EmptyRectangle, XY-Wing, W-Wing, RemotePair, XChain, XYChain,
  SueDeCoq, (Multi)Coloring,
  ALS-Wing, ALS-XZ, ALS-Chain,
 (ALS)DeathBlossom(Ext.), (Grouped)NiceLoop, ForceChain and GeneralLogic.<br>
There are also functions for transposed transformation of Sudoku problems, standardization and ordering of Sudoku problems.  

The algorithm is explained on the HTML page.
